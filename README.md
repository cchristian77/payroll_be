## Payroll API

Payroll API is a robust backend service designed to streamline employee attendance and payroll management. 
This system provides RESTful API endpoints which enables efficient handling of employee attendance, salary calculations, and reporting capabilities, 
utilizing Go and PostgreSQL for reliable data storage. The purpose of this application is for **submission of case study** in **Deals** company.

### Technology
1. Backend: Go v1.23.10
2. Database : Postgres 14.7
3. Docker (optional)

### Project Structure
- `cmd/`: This directory contains application-specific entrypoints. It's the main program of the application.

- `domain/`: This directory holds struct object representation for each table in the database.

- `domain/enums`: This directory holds enums constants for each domain. 

- `entrypoint/`: This directory is the controller layer for API endpoints. The controller layer's function is to accept and validate incoming requests before they are processed by the service layer.

- `migration/`: This directory holds SQL migrations files to create and modify tables in the database.

- `repository/`: This directory is a repository layer to handle interactions between the application and database.

- `request/`: This directory holds HTTP request structures that define the input of the application.

- `response/`: This directory contains HTTP response structures that define the output formats of the API.

- `service/`: This directory implements the core business logic layer, processing data between the controller and repository layers.

- `shared/`: This directory contains external and internal services which the application interacts with. 

- `util/`: This directory holds utility functions and helper code that supports the main application functionality.

#### Library
- `echo`: Web framework for building HTTP API
- `gorm`: The ORM for database operations
- `koanf`: The config environment library
- `jwt`: JSON Web Token for authentication
- `validator`: validation library
- `uuid`: Generate and handle UUID
- `pgx`: PostgreSQL driver
- `decimal`: Handling decimal numbers with precision
- `zap`: Structured logging library
- `crypto`: Cryptography functions for password hashing
- `testify`: Unit Testing library
- `sqlmock`: Mock SQL for database testing
